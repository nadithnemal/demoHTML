    <h3>Importance of Ethical Hacking</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Protecting Systems:</b> Ethical hackers play a crucial role in safeguarding organizations from cyber threats.</li>
        <li><b>Compliance:</b> Many industries require regular security assessments to comply with regulations.</li>
        <li><b>Bug Bounty Programs:</b> Companies offer rewards to ethical hackers who discover vulnerabilities.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>2. How to Start Learning Ethical Hacking</h2>
